## Wallet Export Format

Pangoline Wallet employs robust encryption through the [Stanford JS Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/) to safeguard your backup. To access the private key of your wallet, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the settings within your Pangoline Wallet.

2. Select your wallet from the options available.

3. Click on "more options."

4. Choose "wallet information."

5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and locate the "Extended Private Key" option.

It's vital to exercise caution when handling this information since possessing the extended private key grants the ability to sign any transaction from your wallet.

Additionally, the backup includes a key called `publicKeyRing`, which stores the extended public keys of the Copayers. The derivation of addresses depends on the value of the `derivationStrategy` key, which can follow either [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) or [BIP45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki) standards. It's noteworthy that wallets created in Copay v1.2 and later versions exclusively utilize BIP44, whereas all previous wallets adhere to BIP45.

Additionally, please be aware that starting from Copay version v1.2, non-multisignature wallets utilize Pay-to-PublicKeyHash (P2PKH) address types, while multisignature wallets continue to employ Pay-to-ScriptHash (P2SH) (as indicated by the `addressType` key in the backup).

| Copay Version | Wallet Type               | Derivation Strategy | Address Type |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| <1.2          | All                       | BIP45               | P2SH         |
| ≥1.2          | Non-multisig              | BIP44               | P2PKH        |
| ≥1.2          | Multisig                  | BIP44               | P2SH         |
| ≥1.5          | Multisig Hardware wallets | BIP44 (root m/48’)  | P2SH         |

By leveraging a tool such as the [Bitcore PlayGround](http://pangi.io/playground), it becomes possible to generate a plethora of wallet addresses with ease. Here are some helpful tips to streamline the process:

1. For P2PKH address type wallets, navigate to the 'Address' section within the Bitcore PlayGround.

2. For P2SH address type wallets, head to the 'Multisig Address' section.

3. In the case of multisignature addresses, it's imperative to ascertain the required number of signatures (referred to as key 'm' in the export) needed for reassembling the addresses.

It's worth noting a key detail about BIP45: All addresses generated using BWS (Bitcoin Wallet Service) with BIP45 adhere to the 'shared cosigner index,' which is set at 2147483647. Consequently, Copay address indexes exhibit the following structure:

- Main addresses: `m/45'/2147483647/0/x`
- Change addresses: `m/45'/2147483647/1/y`

As of version 1.5, Copay has transitioned to employing the root `m/48'` for hardware multisignature wallets. This transition has been closely coordinated with the Ledger and Trezor teams. While the derivation path format remains similar to BIP44, the adoption of this new root signifies that these wallets are no longer discoverable through the conventional method of scanning addresses for funds. For the generation of addresses in multisignature wallets, it becomes essential to possess the extended public keys of the other copayers.
